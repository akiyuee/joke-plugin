### BestOptimizationPlugin
Because there are 2 `/`.

# FAQ
##### What does this plugin do?
Tries to kill all entities on startup, then print a message to the console, saying "Optimized entities". But I messed up and left an unnecessary `/` in the command string, making the entire plugin useless.

##### Why did you make this?
It was originally intended as an inside joke for me and my friends on a Discord server, but I think it would be funny to post on Reddit.

##### I'm mad at you for lying to me!
Sorry.
